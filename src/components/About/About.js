      <p>
        A vintage car is, in the most general sense, an old automobile, and in
        the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car from
        the period of 1919 to 1930. Such enthusiasts have categorization schemes
        for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between antique cars, vintage
        cars, classic cars, and so on.

        The vintage era in the automotive world was a time of transition. The
        car started off in 1919 as still something of a rarity, and ended up, in
        1930, well on the way towards ubiquity. In fact, automobile production
        at the end of this period was not matched again until the 1950s. In the
        intervening years, most industrialized countries built nationwide road
        systems with the result that, towards the end of the period, the ability
        to negotiate unpaved roads was no longer a prime consideration of
        automotive design.

        Cars became much more practical, convenient and comfortable during this
        period. Car heating was introduced (progressing from hot bricks via
        double-skinned exhaust manifolds to the heater radiator matrix), as was
        the in-car radio. Four-wheel braking from a common foot pedal was
        introduced, as was the use of hydraulically actuated brakes.
